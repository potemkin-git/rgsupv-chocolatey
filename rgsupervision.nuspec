      # RG System Suite by Septeo© - Supervision agent

      This software made by RG System Suite by Septeo© deploys a supervision agent which includes features for:
      - Remote Monitoring and Management
      - Remote desktop access (Assist)
      - Backup (Files and Data, Microsoft 365)
      - Security (BitDefender integration)
      - ...and many other (automation, scripting, reports)

      ## Requirements
      All agent features and monitored data will be available within the RG System Suite by Septeo© dashboard (or through authenticated API).

      A user account will be required prior deploying, in order to authenticate with your **deployment token**.
      This token can be generated from the user profile page within dashboard (parameters tab).

      Don't have any account ? Visit https://www.rgsystem.com for more information.

      ## Package parameters
      The following package parameters must be set:
      * `/Token:` (string) User deployment token used for authentication while registering agent (required)
      * `/Node:`  (integer) Node ID where agent will be located within dashboard (optional, default to user's root node)
      * `/ExpectedHostName:`  (string) Only for advanced users: Custom host name used for registration (optional, bad usage may prevent proper installation)

      To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` within install command.
      Example: `choco install rgsupervision [other options] --params "'/Token:mytokenvalue /Node:12345'"`

      ## Package update
      This installer deploys the version 2.4.108.0 of RG System Suite by Septeo© Supervision agent (for Windows operating systems). 
      Following updates will be automatically handled by agent self update feature. Hence, no Chocolatey update action is required.
